          you'd like to write a program to find out how many letters occur multiple times in a given word. \n \
          Your program should read a word from the input and then sort the letters of the word alphabetically  \n \
          (by their ASCII codes). Next, your program should iterate through the letters of the word and \n \
          compare each letter with the one following it. If these equal each other, you increase a counter by 1,  \n \
          making sure to then skip ahead far enough so that letters that occur more than twice are not counted again. \n \
          You may assume that the word you read from the input has no more than 50 letters, and that the word is all lowercase.  \n \

    /*

    IF-ELSE statement shortcut in C

    C has the following syntax for a shorthand IF-ELSE statement

    (integer == 5) ? (TRUE) : (FALSE);
    I often find myself requiring only one portion (TRUE or FALSE) of the statement and use this

    (integer == 5) ? (TRUE) : (0);
    I was just wondering if there was a way to not include the ELSE portion of the statement using this shorthand notation?

    The operator ?: must return a value. If you didn't have the "else" part, what would it return when the boolean
    expression is false? A sensible default in some other languages may be null, but probably not for C. If you just
    need to do the "if" and you don't need it to return a value, then typing if is a lot easier.
    Question is whether we can somehow write the following expression without both then and else parts

    (integer == 5) ? (THENEXPR) : (ELSEEXPR);
    If you only need the then part you can use &&:

    (integer == 5) && (THENEXPR)
    If you only need the else part use ||:

    (integer == 5) || (ELSEEXPR)
